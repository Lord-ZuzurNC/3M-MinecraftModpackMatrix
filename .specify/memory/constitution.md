# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

1. **User Input Handling**

   - **Rule**: The application must accept user input of Minecraft mods and validate it according to the specified format.
   - **Rationale**: Ensures that the app can process valid mod data correctly.

2. **Output Specification**

   - **Rule**: The application must output the common mod loader and MC version based on the provided mod information.
   - **Rationale**: Provides clear and consistent output for users to understand which mod loader and Minecraft version their mods are compatible with.

3. **Data Validation**

   - **Rule**: All user inputs must be validated against predefined criteria (e.g., valid mod IDs, supported MC versions).
   - **Rationale**: Prevents invalid data from causing errors or unexpected behavior in the application.

4. **Performance Optimization**

   - **Rule**: The application should be optimized to handle large datasets efficiently.
   - **Rationale**: Ensures that the app remains responsive even when dealing with a high number of mods.

5. **Security Measures**
   - **Rule**: Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Rationale**: Protects sensitive information and maintains user trust.
